- Background color: Light pale green (#E6F4EA), very low saturation to create a calm, friendly backdrop that doesn't clash with the primary color.
- Accent color: Seafoam green (#74C69D), a brighter shade of analogous green, to highlight important interactive elements and confirm user actions.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif with a modern look and a little warmth or personality.
